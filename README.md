Video: https://vimeo.com/113176947

GoPedal transforms the average bike into a more convenient and responsive ride for the everyday cyclist. GoPedal enhances the safety of the cyclist by adding automatic headlights, taillights, turn signals, and proximity detection. Automatic theft detection, and location querying allow GoPedal to free you of any worries when you're away from your bike. Integration with your smartphone allows GoPedal to provide you with a more convenient ride.

This Project uses the Arduino UNO with several parts outlined in the video along with a Rails powered web server.
